LeagueSharp's normal subscriptions are limited to **50 games per day**. If you plan on exceeding this limit, you can purchase a botting license. The Botting License is another type of Subscription that allows you to play **unlimited amount of games per day**. It is worthwhile for people who are botting a large amount of accounts and require more than our 50 game limit. Please keep in mind that the Botting License will not remove your HWID lock, meaning that you will not be able to play on different devices simultaneously using your account, but you can copy the virtual machine with same HWID and play on as many instances as your computer can handle.

To purchase a Botting subscription, [go to the **Store**](https://www.joduska.me/forum/store/) or [click here](https://www.joduska.me/forum/store/product/28-1-month-botting-license/). Please check the item description so you know exactly what you are buying. If you have assured that the selected products are the right ones, continue with a click on "**Checkout**". Now you can select your prefered payment method. If you want to use the Botting license with another account, you may create another account by using your invitations, otherwise please open a ticket and ask for an invitation.
