**Only one computer can be used to play on your account at a time. **
***
If you will try to run the PlaySharp on multiple computers with the single account simultaneously and join the game, one of the clients will start constantly returning **HWID lock** error. That means that the account is currently locked to be used on a computer you last used to play game.
This error remains for 1 hour since the last injection, so if you want to play on other machine once again, you will have to wait for that time period. Also please restrain from trying to inject into the game during the HWID lock as it may prolong the suspension. 

If you want to be able to run multiple instances using the same account, you can use virtual machine to emulate the Windows environment keeping the same Hardware ID, but keep in mind that you only have a limited amount of games per day, so running multiple games at once may drain the count pretty fast. If you want to use PlaySharp for botting purposes, please consider getting the Botting License.
