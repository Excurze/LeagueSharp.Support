If you think like your account security might have been compromised or there is any other reason to change your account information, you can change your E-Mail address and the password linked to your account.

In order to access the account settings page, click on the small button with your nickname on it on the top left side of the site, next to your profile picture ([where?](https://s.put.re/FGb8K4F.png)). Select "[My Settings](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=core&module=usercp)" and navigate to the "[Email & Password](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=core&module=usercp&tab=core&area=email)" tab. Here you can change your account E-Mail address(➊) and account password(➋):

➊ In order to change your E-Mail address linked to your account, you first need to send the security code to your current E-Mail address. To do so, press "[Click here to request a security code](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=core&module=usercp&tab=core&area=email&code)". Now open your mailbox (*the mail may be in your Spam folder*) and you'll see letter which will look like this ([picture](https://s.put.re/StY7NJd.png)). Copy the security code from the letter and past it in the corresponding field in your settings page on the forum. Press "**Save changes**" on the bottom of the page and now you're able to type in your new E-Mail address!

➋ To change your password, you need to enter the current E-Mail address which is registered on your LeagueSharp account and current password. After entering the *correct* credentials, type in your new password in the corresponding field and then repeat it again in the password confirmation field. After everything is filled, press "**Save changes**" button on the bottom of the page and now you're ready to use your new password!

However, keep in mind that you will have to present solid proofs of you being an account owner, such as payment receipts and original E-Mail address.
