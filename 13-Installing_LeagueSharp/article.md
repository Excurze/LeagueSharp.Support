In order to install PlaySharp you need to download it first. You can always find the download link on the main page of the forum in PlaySharp category: 
>[**Download PlaySharp**](https://www.joduska.me/forum/forum/177-download-playsharp/)

Now after you have successfully downloaded the setup executable, run it (*preferably* [*as Administrator*](https://img.joduska.me/?q=https://s.put.re/L14GD6u.png)). As the destination folder it is preferred to install PlaySharp in **C:\ root folder** ([?](https://s.put.re/bKQgzy5.png)) to avoid some possible issues which may emerge. After choosing the destination folder, you'll see the window asking what software the loader should install ([?](https://s.put.re/iPvVTfK.png)), if you are unsure - leave everything by default and proceed to the installation process.

>**Note**: If your destination folder will contain word "*PlaySharp*" in its name, the name will be randomized. In this case, when asked agree to create a shortcut on the desktop for your convenience!

When the installation process is finished, the loader will start automatically. It will perform a randomization and log you in your account. If the loader failed to log you in automatically, do it manually by pasting your Authentication Key from [**Account Status**](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=core&module=usercp&tab=leaguesharp) page manually. Remember not to share your Authentication Key with anyone, it can be used to grant access to your account!
