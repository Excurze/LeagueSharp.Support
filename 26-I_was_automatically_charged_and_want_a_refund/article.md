In case you failed to cancel your LeagueSharp subscription and you were automatically charged for it there is not anything we can do. We do not offer any refunds for a specific reason. Once a subscription is renewed we allocate resources for your account for the time that you will be Subscriber, meaning we pay money for server space, computing time, database connections and bandwidth, therefore we pay upfront for your Subscriber status and a refund is not possible.

>Please read "[How to cancel your LeagueSharp subscription](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=infotickets&page=article&id=25#/article)" article to assure that you are able to cancel your subscription in the future.
