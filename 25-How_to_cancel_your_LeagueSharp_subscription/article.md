If you have paid using PayPal, you will be **automatically** charged when your subscription expires. If you do not want to extend your LeagueSharp subscription, you need to **cancel it through PayPal**. To do this, go to [PayPal's website](https://www.paypal.com/) and log into the account you used to buy the LeagueSharp subscription. After successfully logging in, you will notice a little gear next to the "logout" button on the top right side of the page ([where?](https://s.put.re/n1tVdJG.png)). Click on the gear and you will end up in "**Account**" page. Click on a menu named "**Payments**" ([where?](https://s.put.re/DdehtNc.png)).  Then select "[Preapproved Payments](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_manage-paylist)" ([where?](https://s.put.re/uTE8dVd.png)). Select the subscription you would like to cancel. On the bottom of the page you will see a "**Cancel Subscription**" button.
