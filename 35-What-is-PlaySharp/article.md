**PlaySharp** is the name of the collaborative project of LeagueSharp and EnsageSharp, scripting platforms for League of Legends and DotA 2 respectively. After getting a subscription, both tools are accessible. So even if you're LeagueSharp subscriber, you can use EnsageSharp and vice versa. Even though both platforms use same forum, two different tabs are used for each platform in order to make forum usage more comfortable for those who only play one of the games. You can choose the tab you want in the upper part of the forum, right below the Shoutbox ([where?](https://s.put.re/m9sPK6h.png)).

**Playsharp** is also the name of the loader which can serve as a scripting platform for both games. You can find a [download link](https://www.joduska.me/forum/forum/177-download-playsharp/) in the top of the front page.
