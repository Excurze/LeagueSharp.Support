You will be **notified** when your subscription is about to end (**three days** in advance). If you want to check the current status of your account and your subscription, you can click on your name on top of the page and navigate to the "[Account Status](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=core&module=usercp&tab=leaguesharp)" page. You will be presented with a **brief overview** of your account, including the date your subscription expires, the games you played today and when the game counter resets.
In case LeagueSharp is **outdated** for a longer period of time, you can also [activate your **compensated days** here](https://www.joduska.me/forum/index.php?app=core&module=usercp&tab=compensation).
For detailed information regarding our **compensation policy**, see also:
